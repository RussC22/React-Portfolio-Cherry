      I am a recent graduate student from UNC Charlotte with an M.S in Management and a B.S. in Health Systems Management. My goal is to demonstrate while expanding the knowledge and skills Iâ€™ve obtained in previous roles and scholastically. I enjoy working with teams and individually to achieve goals; this approach allows me to maintain my journey as a lifelong learner. I have always been interested in helping others. I never shy away from a challenge or tough situation. I am someone capable of making tough decisions. I enjoy my wins and learn from my failures; regardless, I always give a task my all. My goal is to leave a lasting impression with my co-workers, superiors, and customers.
